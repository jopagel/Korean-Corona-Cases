# Korean-Corona-Cases

## Introduction

The preceding analysis deals with a structured dataset of Corona patients in Korea. It is provided by the KCDC (Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention) and consists of 14 features discribing 5,165 patients infected with the Corona Virus in 2020. It can be downloaded on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset).

## Questions of interest

The analysis includes different data preparation steps that transform the initial dataset into a suitable selection of features to answer the following questions:

- Which province had the most Corona cases?
- Is there any difference in duration of illness for male vs female citizen?
- Which features have the biggest influence on the duration of the infection?

These answers to these questions can be found in the [Notebook](https://github.com/jopagel/Korean-Corona-Cases/blob/main/Data_Analysis.ipynb).

## Depencies

The dependencies are definied in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/jopagel/Korean-Corona-Cases/blob/main/requirements.txt) file.
